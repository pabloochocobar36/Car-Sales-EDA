# Car-Sales-EDA

- The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a vehicle sales dataset to uncover key insights, patterns, and trends related to vehicle sales. The analysis will focus on understanding various factors that influence vehicle prices, identifying the distribution of vehicle attributes (such as make, model, year, and interior color), and exploring relationships between these attributes and sales outcomes.
